    "# Baseline simulations and deterministic sensitivity analyses\n",
    "In this notebook computations for a health state transition model, commonly referred to as Markov model, are implemented. In the healthcare setting a patient can be in a predefined set of Markov states (health states) per unit of time. Each health state is related with a health reward (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) and costs per unit of time. Furthermore, transitions between health states are possible based on defined transition probabilities. For further explanation of Markov models read Markov_model_explanation.docx in the repository.\n",

    "Next to the baseline simulation results the code below directly computes deterministic one-way sensitivity analyses based on percentages change. In one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses no correlation between parameters was included, thus each parameter is changed while all the other parameters are set to their baseline value. Given a percentage change for every model parameter the simulated Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), costs (€), and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB in €) cumulative over a 5 year simulated follow-up are computed. An explanation of the background of the computations is available in the Markov_model_explanation.docx file in this repository.\n",
