    "# Probabilistic sensitivity analysis: uniform distributed parameters\n",
    "In probabilistic sensitivity analyses distributions of baseline parameters are resampled multiple times from a distribution. Subsequently, the Markov model is implemented for the defined simulation period and cumulative outcomes for the cohort are computed (QALYs: Quality-Adjusted Life Years, costs in €, NMB: Net Monetary Benefit in €). This is often referred to as the term Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The computations below implement draws of model parameters from a uniform distribution between minumum and maximum values of the model parameters.
