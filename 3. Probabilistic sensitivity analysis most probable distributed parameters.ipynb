    "# Probabilistic sensitivity analysis: most probable distributed parameters\n",
    "In probabilistic sensitivity analyses distributions of baseline parameters are resampled multiple times from a distribution. Subsequently, the Markov model is implemented for the defined simulation period and cumulative outcomes for the cohort are computed (QALYs: Quality-Adjusted Life Years, costs in €, NMB: Net Monetary Benefit in €). This is often referred to as the term Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The computations below implement draws of model parameters from the most probable distribution. The data used refers to the study (appendix D includes all parameters used): <br>\n",
