# CostEffectiveness
In this repository the python code is provided for a cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) based on a health state transition ('Markov') model as described in the study:

Cost and health effects of case management compared to outpatient clinic follow-up in a Dutch heart failure cohort

H. van Voorst and dr. A.E.R. Arnold

Published April 2020 in ESC Heart Failure Journal
Results were first presented at the annual European Society of Cardiology Heart failure congress 25-28 May 2018 in Vienna. 

Four files are available:
1. Baseline simulations and one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses
2. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis: uniform distributed parameters
3. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis: most probable distributed parameters 
4. Word document that describes the model architecture
